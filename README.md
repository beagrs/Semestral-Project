### Projects description
In this project, I discovered and implemented an innovative configuration for integrated temperature sensing, which resulted in achieving a final accuracy of 1.5Â°C across more than 100 measurements. This improvement significantly enhanced thermal management and cooling efficiency. I developed a numerical solver in Python to simulate the timing and accuracy of the configuration, and used LTSpice for further analysis. Additionally, I designed the temperature-sensing device and the TTV PCB, conducting thorough laboratory testing to validate the results
